# The redirector interface of Squid has been changed since Squid 3.4
# and hence it is required to set the Squid version so that ufdbguardd
# communicates with Squid using the version-dependent protocol.
# valid version numbers are: 3.5, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0 etc.
# Contact the helpdesk of URLfilterDB for newer versions of Squid.
## EDIT THE NEXT LINE FOR LOCAL CONFIGURATION:

# When Squid uses ssl-bump in peek+bump mode, squid-uses-active-bumping
# must be on.
## EDIT THE NEXT LINE FOR LOCAL CONFIGURATION:

# When Squid does NOT use ssl-bump in peek+bump mode, blocked HTTPS connections are
# redirected to the URL "blockedhttps.urlfilterdb.com:443" by default.
# This may be overrruled by setting redirect-https
# Note that redirect-https does not accept a full URL but must have a FQDN followed by ":443"
# Examples:
# redirect-https "foo.example.com:443"
# redirect-https "noconnect.urlfilterdb.com:443"

# When a URL database is reloaded/updated, it is not possible to
# perform URL lookups.  The next parameters defines what to respond
# to URL lookups during a database load (this typically takes 30 seconds);
# url-lookup-result-during-database-reload allow   - always send
#   status "URL allowed" back to Squid (default)
# url-lookup-result-during-database-reload deny    - always send
#   status "URL denied" back to Squid
url-lookup-result-during-database-reload allow
# and the same for when a fatal error occurs:
url-lookup-result-when-fatal-error allow

# when url-lookup-result-during-database-reload and/or
# url-lookup-result-when-fatal-error is set to "deny", the browsers
# are redirected and display an appropriate message.
# To overrule these message, one can use the following two parameters:
# redirect-fatal-error      "http://www.example.com/fatalerror.html"
# redirect-loading-database "http://www.example.com/loadingdb.html"

# ufdbguardd reloads the configuration and database when it receives a HUP signal.
# Until version 1.35 the refresh was done by unloading current database + loading new config and new database
# which may take 3 or more seconds.
# Starting with version 1.35 the database can be refreshed faster by
#    - load new config and database.  NOTE: the currently load database is still used
#    - in a split second signal all worker threads to use the new config and database
#    - unload the old config and database
# The above "fast refresh" reduces the 3+ second loading interval to a couple of milliseconds *and*
# needs up to double the amount of memory since for a short while there are two copies of the database loaded
# in memory.
## EDIT THE NEXT LINE FOR LOCAL CONFIGURATION:
fast-refresh on

# Startig with version 1.35 ufdbguardd can give hints to Linux to use transparent hugepages for database tables.
# If madvise-hugepages is on, ufdbguardd uses madvise(2) OS calls for tables that are at least 1.6 MB.
# Note that transparent hugepages increases overall system and application performance IF the whole
# application fits into memory and may reduce performance otherwise.
